# Navigation-Stack
NavigationStack is a SwiftUI container view used to manage hierarchical navigation in an app. It lets you push and pop screens (views) in a stack-based flow, similar to how navigation works in iOS apps with a back button.

Why it’s used
Replaces NavigationView (modern API)
Supports programmatic navigation
Enables deep linking
Gives full control over navigation state
Works cleanly with MVVM architecture
